#Auth Code using PayPal iOS SDK

###Issues

a) The authorization code generated by PayPal-iOS-SDK for Profile Sharing use case is constant -

`EJhi9jOPswug9TDOv93qg4Y28xIlqPDpAoqd7biDLpeGCPvORHjP1Fh4CbFPgKMGCHejdDwe9w1uDWnjPCp1lkaFBjVmjvjpFtnr6z1YeBbmfZYqa9faQT_71dmgZhMIFVkbi4yO7hk0LBHXt_wtdsw`

b) The `kPayPalOAuth2ScopeEmail` scope seems to fail. You cannot see this specific scope in the user consent. Please give some advise.

###Instructions 

1) Open `NativeApp.xcodeproj` in [Xcode Version 5.1.1](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action#). 

2) Build the project Command (âŒ˜) + R

3) Login with your [PayPal Sandbox credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/lifecycle/sb_create-accounts/).

4) The PayPal iOS SDK provides an API to obtain user consent for profile sharing. The SDK is integrated into this sample app and is using it to authenticate the user and obtain the user's consent. The SDK handles authentication and authorization with the PayPal authentication server, and returns an OAuth2 authorization code as the output.

###Project 

A simple project addressing the authorization code issue in PayPal iOS SDK 2.3.2. 

###Response

This authorization response is a NSDictionary object. Example:

    {
    client =     {
        environment = sandbox;
        "paypal_sdk_version" = "2.3.2";
        platform = iOS;
        "product_name" = "PayPal iOS SDK";
    };
    response =     {
        code = "EJhi9jOPswug9TDOv93qg4Y28xIlqPDpAoqd7biDLpeGCPvORHjP1Fh4CbFPgKMGCHejdDwe9w1uDWnjPCp1lkaFBjVmjvjpFtnr6z1YeBbmfZYqa9faQT_71dmgZhMIFVkbi4yO7hk0LBHXt_wtdsw";
    };
    "response_type" = "authorization_code";
    }
